## APRS TNC Decoder and OLED display

This is HAM Radio project releate to APRS (Automatic Packet Reporting System) for send and receive positioning report via HAM radio equipment.

TNC mean Terminal Node Controller. use for translate between Packet Radio (APRS) protocol to Serial data (RS232)

In this version of project. Idea to use one Arduino Pro mini board to decode APRS and display packet infomation to OLED.
